*  Use 'mut' keyword to make variables mutable;
*  Use 'const' keyword to make constant variable in which 'mut' keyword can not be used ;
*  Constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime ;
*  Rustâ€™s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with underscores between words
